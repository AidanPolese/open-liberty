/**
 * The <code>EJBContextExtension</code> interface may be used by an
 * EJB to invoke WebSphere-specific EJB Container services. <p>
 * 
 * An EJB may invoke the EJBContextExtension methods by casting the context
 * object passed into the EJB's setSessionContext(), setEntityContext() or
 * setMessageDrivenContext() method, to
 * com.ibm.websphere.ejbcontainer.EJBContextExtension. Typically the code in
 * setSessionContext(), setEntityContext() or setMessageDrivenContext assigns
 * the context object to a bean instance variable for later use by other
 * bean methods. <p>
 * 
 * In WebSphere, all javax.ejb.EJBContext objects also implement this interface.
 * This allows the bean to use a single 'context' instance variable (of type
 * EJBContextExtension) and be able to invoke EJB specification-defined methods
 * as well as WebSphere-defined methods on the same context object. It is also
 * possible, of course, to assign the context object to two instance variables,
 * one of type javax.ejb.EJBContext and another of type
 * com.ibm.websphere.ejbcontainer.EJBContextExtension. <p>
 * 
 * For each subinterface of javax.ejb.EJBContext, a corresponding
 * WebSphere-defined context extension interface extends both the applicable
 * subinterface of EJBContext and this EJBContextExtension interface.
 * See {@link EntityContextExtension}, {@link MessageDrivenContextExtension},
 * and {@link SessionContextExtension}. <p>
 * 
 * <b>Note: Application use of some of the methods on this interface may result
 * in behavior not
 * compliant with the official EJB specification.</b> If this is the case, the
 * documentation for that method will indicate so. <p>

     * a query over persistent storage to insure all modifications to
     * entity EJB instances within the current transaction are reflected
     * in the query results. <p>
     * 
     * For EJBs packaged in a Java EE 1.3 or later module, the EJB Container will
     * automatically flush the persistent state prior to executing any "custom" finder

     * the application would not need to invoke this method. (Unless the EJB
     * has explicitly disabled the flush behavior; see below.)<p>

     * for those EJBs packaged in Java EE 1.2 or earlier
     * modules, or for EJBs that implement the {@link DisableFlushBeforeFind} interface. <p>
     *

     * the EJB Specification -- applications are allowed to perform manual
     * cache flushes in addition to those done automatically by the container. <p>
