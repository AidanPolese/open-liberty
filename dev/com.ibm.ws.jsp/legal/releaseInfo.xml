<![CDATA[
Added class:

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/JspShim.java
    Isolates Liberty and traditional WAS differences.

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/taglib/JspInputSourceFromInputStreamImpl.java
    Wrapper for JSP input from an input stream instead of a uri.

Modified classes:

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/configuration/JspConfiguration.java
    Creating the org.apache.el.ExpressionFactoryImpl directly but really want to use
    ExpressionFactory.newInstance() if we can get it to work.
    
    Use the JspShim to wrap the expression factory instead of referencing webbeans directly.

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/inputsource/JspURLConnection.java
    Added @FFDCIgnore(IOException.class) to the public InputStream getInputStream() method.

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/taglib/GlobalTagLibraryCache.java
    Use the JspShim to isolate System.getProperty("was.install.root") vs. using AlpineLocation.

    Added code to use loadTldFromClassloader(GlobalTagLibConfig globalTagLibConfig, TldParser tldParser)
    so that we use the class loader and not the jar to get the tag libs.

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/webcontainerext/JSPExtensionFactory.java
    Added Declarative Services support.
    
    Set the default JSP factory when createConfig is called if it's not already set.
    
    Added support to make the class path available from JspClassloaderContext.getClassPath().

  com/ibm/ws/jsp/webcontainerext/package-info.java
    Add the @TraceOptions for the jsp trace group.
    
  com/ibm/ws/jsp/runtime/HttpJspBase.java
    Updated the init method to put the JSPs classloader on the thread prior to running init. TCL is reset after.
    
 Open source libs:
 
   xalan and xerces jars sourced from: http://apache.petsads.us/xml/xalan-j/binaries/xalan-j_2_7_0-bin-2jars.zip   
   This has OSSC review level 1:  "Products which bundle newer versions of Xerces-J/Xalan-J may have no IBM alternatives, 
   and they would need to complete a Verified Package checklist for these Apache releases (exempt from EPR) and go 
   through the OSSC review process themselves. "
