  <p>This basic runtime package includes all you need to get up and running with a WAS Liberty server. To keep the footprint small,
    only the subset of technologies required to run OSGi applications is included.</p>
  <p>If you need Web Services, JMS, or MongoDB support, these can be installed through bin/installUtility.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <div>
  <p>There are two ways to download and install the WAS Liberty runtime:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From within your Eclipse IDE.</li>
