  <p>This beta runtime package includes all you need to get up and running with a WAS Liberty server. To keep the download small
    only the Java EE 7 Web Profile technologies and the latest beta features are included. The beta download requires Java 8.
  </p>
  <p>If additional features are desired, such as monitoring, LDAP Registry, Web Services, JMS, or MongoDB support,
    these can be added through bin/installUtility.</p>
  <p>The beta download is not supported for production.</p>
