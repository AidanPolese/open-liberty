Do not change the server.xml for the beta-zos profile unless new zOS features are in beta.
The beta for zOS already includes all of the beta content for the vanilla beta as well as
all of the content for zOS.

The zOS beta is special because its basically all content available for zOS (core, base, nd, zos).

The logic for this beta is customized in macros.xml, because the zip produced by this
profile needs to be pcakaged on zOS as a pax.
