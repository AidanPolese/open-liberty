<!-- Additions to this file require additions to either the ndControllerBundle or the
     ndMemberBundle files in the collectives component: 
     /com.ibm.websphere.appserver.ndControllerBundle/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.ndControllerBundle.feature
     /com.ibm.websphere.appserver.ndMemberBundle/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.ndMemberBundle.feature
     
     Depending on the feature, it is either intended for an ND member or an ND controller.
     Update the appropriate bundle feature file.
     
     If either of those files are not changed, the release build WILL fail.
