<p>This basic runtime package includes all you need to get up and running with a WAS Liberty server. To keep the footprint small,
  only a subset of technologies is included. If you need Web Services, JMS, or MongoDB support, also download and install the Extended
  Programming Models package in addition to this install.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
There are two ways to download and install the WAS Liberty runtime:
<ul>
  <li>From within your Eclipse IDE.</li>
  <li>As a standalone JAR file that you install from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing from within Eclipse</h3>
