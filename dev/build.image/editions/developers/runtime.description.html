<p>This basic runtime package includes all you need to get up and running with a Liberty profile server. To keep the footprint small,
  only a subset of technologies is included. If you need Web Services, JMS, or MongoDB support, also download and install the Extended
  package in addition to this install.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
There are two ways to download and install the Liberty profile runtime:
<ul>
  <li>From within your Eclipse IDE.</li>
  <li>As a standalone JAR file that you install from the command line.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing from within Eclipse</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If you don&#8217;t already have Eclipse, install <a
    href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunasr2">Eclipse 4.4.2 for Java EE Developers (Luna
      SR2)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Select the following Install button <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=1778478" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse workspace."><img class="img-responsive" src="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse workspace." /></a>, drop it onto the Eclipse toolbar, and then follow the prompts. This installs the WebSphere Developer Tools into
    your Eclipse installation.
  </li>
  <li>In the Servers view of Eclipse, right-click to define a new Liberty profile server. This opens a wizard to guide you through the
    process. The wizard includes the option to download and install the runtime as a part of defining a new server.</li>
</ol>
