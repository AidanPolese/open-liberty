   <notes>
   The download location is the FE.zip that includes the C:\dev\WASX\bld\SERV1\ws\code\prereq.elimpl\build\lib\jasper-el.jar,
   which has then been renamed.
   
   Classes in org.apche.japser.el move to jsp-2.2 under same package name.

   <clearencehistory>
   As implied by the download location, this comes from WAS v8.5 and has been cleared previously by WAS v8.5
