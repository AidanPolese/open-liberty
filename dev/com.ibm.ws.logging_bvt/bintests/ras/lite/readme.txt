This TrTest is designed to test for binary compatibility of the com.ibm.ejs.ras.Tr
class with consuming classes built against the WAS version of the Tr class.  These
class files have been built on WAS and should NOT be replaced with anything that
has NOT been built on WAS, nor should they be rebuilt from the source provided
here which is just to aid debug should any test fail.
