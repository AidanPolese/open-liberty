   These equinox binaries are from the current stream for the ongoing 4.6.2 Equinox (Neon.2) release.
   The 4.6.2 Equinox release is not yet available from the IBM Eclipse SDK (IES) download site.
   A separate OSSC approval needs to be done on these binaries until the 4.6.2 Equinox (Neon.2)
   release is made available from the IBM Eclipse SDK (IES) download site and is on the
   All Usage Approved (AUA) list.
