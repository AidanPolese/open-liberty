* Explanation: The entry linkage found the angel stack prefix area
*              hung off the common task data anchor, but the in-use
*              bit was already set.
* Suggested Action: "IBM Internal Only"
* Internal Explanation: It's possible that an IRB got control on this
*                       task and is trying to use the stack prefix
