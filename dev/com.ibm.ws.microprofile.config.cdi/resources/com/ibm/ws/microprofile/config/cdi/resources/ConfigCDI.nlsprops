# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.

# Messages used by Config CDI autofeature
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Unable to determine the generic type of the ConfigValue to be injected at "{0}".
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E=CWMCG5001E: Unable to determine the type of the property to be injected. The type of the injection point was "{0}".
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E.explanation=The injection point annotated with the @ConfigProperty qualifier did not have a valid type.
unable.to.determine.injection.type.CWMCG5001E.useraction=Ensure that the injection point has a valid type for the property you wish to inject.

# The property name must be specified for Constructor and Method configuration property injection.
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E=CWMCG5002E: The property name must be specified for Constructor and Method configuration property injection.
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E.explanation=It is not possible to derive the default property name for the Constructors and Method parameters. The correct property name must be passed to the @ConfigProperty qualifier. 
unable.to.determine.injection.name.CWMCG5002E.useraction=Set the correct property name using the @ConfigProperty qualifier.

# InjectionPoint dependency could not be resolved: {0}. The exception is {1}.
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E=CWMCG5003E: InjectionPoint dependency could not be resolved: {0}. The exception is {1}.
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E.explanation=It was not possible to resolve an injected Config Property. Either the named property could not be found or a Converter for the required type could not be resolved. 
unable.to.resolve.injection.point.CWMCG5003E.useraction=Check the server's message and ffdc logs to determine the cause. Ensure that the property exists in one of the Config Sources and that the required Converters have been configured.

# The configuration property named "{0}" could not be found.
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E=CWMCG5004E: The configuration property named "{0}" could not be found.
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E.explanation=The named property could not be found in any of the configured sources. 
property.not.found.CWMCG5004E.useraction=Ensure that the property exists in one of the Config Sources.

# Emergency Config error message
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A Config API error has occurred: {0}
temporary.CWMCG5999E=CWMCG5999E: A Config API error has occurred: {0}.
temporary.CWMCG5999E.explanation=A Config API error has occurred that prevents normal operation.
temporary.CWMCG5999E.useraction=Review the server message.log and FFDC logs to identify the problem.
