This file contains information about the origin of the source code in this project.  Please
indicate under 'Origin' where the original drop of source code came from; for example,
a port of WAS code would be 'other IBM dev', and the detail should provide enough information
to track down the COO for that code (eg WAS 7.0 SERV1, j2c.impl).  For 3rd party code the
exact origin of the source is needed (eg link, version etc).

If any alpine development is done (on ported or brand new code) list all the developers who
have worked on the code and their contribution (%) to the total code in the project.

Origin:
