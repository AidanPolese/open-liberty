   The download location is the location where it is downloaded from for the WAS build process
   the file commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows-signed.jar is actually the file commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows-signed.zip downloaded
   from the Apache Commons Daemon site.  It was renamed from zip to jar so that the tooling would do the checksum check.  The tooling
   should be updated to handle zips are well as exe for checksum testing.
