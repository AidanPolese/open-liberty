    JSR 353: Java API for JSON Processing - Reference Implementation and API come packaged in a single jar.
    This Reference Implementation is owned by Oracle and is covered by the TLDA. Therefore, the TLDA supersedes
    the open source license (CDDL v1.1 issued by Oracle), and doesn't require OSSC approval through the AWSOM database.
