<br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source 
or Object <br>
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for 
which the <br>
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
modifications <br>
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For 
the <br>
purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not

that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by 
name) to the <br>
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>

conditions of <br>
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual, <br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable <br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works 
of, publicly <br>
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and <br>
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>

by such <br>
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) <br>
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to <br>
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute 
patent <br>
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim <br>
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated <br>
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent <br>
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under 
this <br>
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation <br>
is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work <br>
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that 
You meet <br>
the following conditions:<br>
<br>
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative <br>
 Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices <br>
 stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative 
Works <br>
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding <br>
 those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative <br>
 Works; and<br>
<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its <br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must <br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained <br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not <br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of <br>
 the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as <br>
 part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, <br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents <br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not <br>
 modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices <br>
 within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an <br>
 addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
such <br>
 additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying <br>
 the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may <br>
provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, <br>
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for 
any such <br>
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and <br>
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the 
conditions stated <br>
in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, <br>
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by <br>
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions 
of this <br>
License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding <br>
the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any <br>
separate license agreement you may have executed with 
Licensor <br>
regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade <br>
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the 
Licensor, <br>
except as required for reasonable and customary use in 
describing the <br>
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed <br>
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor <br>
provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR <br>
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without <br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, <br>
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You 
are solely <br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or <br>
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated 
with Your <br>
exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, <br>
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless <br>
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent <br>
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You <br>
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or <br>
consequential damages of any character arising as a result 
of this <br>
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but <br>
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer <br>
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or <br>
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility <br>
of such damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing <br>
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and <br>
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other <br>
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. <br>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on 
Your own <br>
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of 
any other <br>
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold each <br>
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
claims asserted <br>
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any 
such <br>
warranty or additional liability.<br>

free, non-exclusive license:<br>
a.	under intellectual property rights (other than patent or 
trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make

Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the 
Contributor first distributes such Contribution.<br>
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights 
granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will 
be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered 
Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, 
no patent license is granted by a Contributor:<br>
a.	for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered 
Software; or<br>
b.	for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other 
third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the 
combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of 
its Contributor Version); or<br>
c.	under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the 
absence of its Contributions.<br>
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, 
service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be 
necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your 
choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent 
version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a 
Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br>
2.5. Representation<br>
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes 
its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has 
sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by 
this License.<br>
2.6. Fair Use<br>
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have 
under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, 
or other equivalents.<br>
2.7. Conditions<br>
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the 
licenses granted in Section 2.1.<br>
3. Responsibilities<br>
3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, 
including any Modifications that You create or to which You 
contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform 
recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is 
governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a 
copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict 
the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.<br>
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
a.	such Covered Software must also be made available in 
Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform 
recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such 
Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a 
charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br>
b.	You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms 
of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, 
provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt 
to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code 
Form under this License.<br>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of 
Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements 
of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work 
is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by 
one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not 
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to 
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such 
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, 
at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under 
the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).<br>
3.4. Notices<br>
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license 
notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers 
of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the 
Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may 
alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known 
factual inaccuracies.<br>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your 
own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make 
it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, 
indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional 
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any 
jurisdiction.<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms 
of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code 
they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file 
included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this 
License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, 
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient 
of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
5. Termination<br>
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if 
You become compliant, then the rights granted under this 
License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) 
provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally 
terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such 
Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some 
reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into 
compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are 
reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the 
non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time 
You have received notice of non-compliance with this License 
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days 
after Your receipt of the notice.<br>
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by 
asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a 
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the 
Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 
above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and 
resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors 
under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>
6. Disclaimer of Warranty<br>
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as 
is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, 
implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties 
that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit 
for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as 
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with 
You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, 
You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary 
servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty 
constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered 
Software is authorized under this License except under this 
disclaimer.<br>
7. Limitation of Liability<br>
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether 
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any 
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted 
above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, 
without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have 
been informed of the possibility of such damages. This 
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or 
personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent 
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not 
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.<br>
8. Litigation<br>
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only 
in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains 
its principal place of business and such litigation shall be

held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only 
to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or 
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this 
License against a Contributor.<br>
