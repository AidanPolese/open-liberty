# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.

resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E=CWOWB1007E: The producer field, {0}, has type {1}, which does not match the type of the injected object.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.explanation=CDI found a resource producer field where the type of the field did not match the type of the Java EE resource injected into it.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.useraction=Ensure that the correct Java EE resource is being injected into the resource producer field and that the type of the field matches the type of the resource injected into it.
