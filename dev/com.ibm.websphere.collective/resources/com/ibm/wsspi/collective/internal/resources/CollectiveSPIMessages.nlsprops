REGISTRY_CONFIG_FACTORY_NO_CLIENT_SERVICE=CWWKX8000E: A configuration error has occurred. There is no available RepositoryClient implementation. Specify a feature such as collectiveMember-1.0 or collectiveController-1.0 and define any required configuration to resolve this issue. 
REGISTRY_CONFIG_FACTORY_NO_CLIENT_SERVICE.explanation=The collective features provide the implementation for the RepositoryClient, and no such implementation could be found.
REGISTRY_CONFIG_FACTORY_NO_CLIENT_SERVICE.useraction=Specify a collective feature such as collectiveMember-1.0 or collectiveController-1.0 and define any required configuration to resolve this issue.
