<project name="pass-back">
    <!-- Common place to control which properties we need to 'dump' into the
         pass-back.properties file. This approach is needed because we have
         <antcall> targets which define values needed by the caller. When a
         target is invoked by <antcall>, any newly defined properties will not
         be visible to the caller. This approach allows the caller to load
         the properties we push into pass-back. -->
