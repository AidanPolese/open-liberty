# This file is to be included in the bnd file of any component that needs to 
# publish its resources to applications.  Including components need to provide 
# a pipe-separated list of resources to be published as the value of the
# 'app-resources' variable.
#
# Example bnd.bnd file (note that ordering of include and var does not matter)
