# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.

#An asynchronous message does not return Future.
asynchronous.class.not.returning.future.CWMFT5000E=CWMFT5000E: The asynchronous method {0} does not have a return type of Future.
asynchronous.class.not.returning.future.CWMFT5000E.explanation=All methods in a class that is annotated with org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Asynchronous must have a return type that is assignable from java.util.concurrent.Future.
asynchronous.class.not.returning.future.CWMFT5000E.useraction=Update the return type.

asynchronous.method.not.returning.future.CWMFT5001E=CWMFT5001E: The asynchronous method {0} does not have a return type of Future.
asynchronous.method.not.returning.future.CWMFT5001E.explanation=All methods that are annotated with org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Asynchronous must have a return type that is assignable from java.util.concurrent.Future.
asynchronous.method.not.returning.future.CWMFT5001E.useraction=Update the return type.

#A fallback method does not match the return type of the method that falls back to it.
fallback.policy.return.type.not.match.CWMFT5002E=CWMFT5002E: The fallback method {0} has the wrong return type. The return type must match the return type of the method {1}.
fallback.policy.return.type.not.match.CWMFT5002E.explanation=A fallback method must have the same return type as the method it handles.
fallback.policy.return.type.not.match.CWMFT5002E.useraction=Update the return type.

#A fallback method that should exist cannot be found.
fallback.method.not.found.CWMFT5003E=CWMFT5003E: The fallback method {1} with parameters {2} was not found in class {0}.
fallback.method.not.found.CWMFT5003E.explanation=A fallback method was declared for the method {1}. However, this method does not exist in the class {0}.
fallback.method.not.found.CWMFT5003E.useraction=Either remove the fallback annotation or add the missing method.

#A security exception was thrown while trying to create a fallback policy.
security.exception.acquiring.fallback.method.CWMFT5004E=CWMFT5004E: A security exception occurred when the application server tried to process fallback annotations.
security.exception.acquiring.fallback.method.CWMFT5004E.explanation=In order to create a fallback policy, the application server requires permission to acquire and examine Java methods.
security.exception.acquiring.fallback.method.CWMFT5004E.useraction=Review the security policy of your application server and provide the permissions.

#A problem occurred while converting a system property {0} to type {1}. The raw string value is {2}. The exception is [3}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5005E=CWMFT5005E: A problem occurred while converting a system property {0} to type {1}. The raw string value is {2}. The exception is [3}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5005E.explanation=Any configuration values provided via system properties must be convertable to the appropriate type. e.g. using Long.valueOf(String)
conversion.error.CWMFT5005E.useraction=Check that the specified value is in the correct format for the type of the property it is overriding.

#A problem occurred while converting a system property to type {0}. The raw string value is {1}. The exception is [2}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5006E=CWMFT5006E: A problem occurred while converting a system property to type {0}. The raw string value is {1}. The exception is [2}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5006E.explanation=Any configuration values provided via system properties must be convertable to the appropriate type. e.g. using Long.valueOf(String)
conversion.error.CWMFT5006E.useraction=Check that the specified value is in the correct format for the type of the property it is overriding.

#A problem occurred while converting a system property to type {0}. The raw string value is {1}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5007E=CWMFT5007E: A problem occurred while converting a system property to type {0}. The raw string value is {1}.
conversion.error.CWMFT5007E.explanation=Any configuration values provided via system properties must be convertable to the appropriate type. e.g. using Long.valueOf(String)
conversion.error.CWMFT5007E.useraction=Check that the specified value is in the correct format for the type of the property it is overriding.

#The fallback policies are conflicting.
fallback.policy.conflicts.CWMFT5008E=CWMFT5008E: The fallback policy for the method {0} is incorrect as both Fallback handler class {1} and fallbackMethod {2} were specified. Only one of them should be specified.
fallback.policy.conflicts.CWMFT5008E.explanation=Either fallbackMethod or value should be set, not both.
fallback.policy.conflicts.CWMFT5008E.useraction=Either remove the fallbackMethod or the value from the Fallback annotation.

#Generic error for internal failures.
internal.error.CWMFT5997E=CWMFT5997E: An internal error occurred. The exception is {0}.
internal.error.CWMFT5997E.explanation=The application server experienced an internal error.
internal.error.CWMFT5997E.useraction=Gather a set of traces and open a new issue against your application server.

#Generic error for internal failures.
