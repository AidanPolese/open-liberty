# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contains three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
#    retrieve data.  This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) A equals ("=") sign separating the key and text.  This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to
#    the user when running the application.  This is required and
#    SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND quoted string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user.  For example, say you have the
# following string to translate:
#
#   This file was written by the IBM Administrator on {0,date}.
#
# {0,date} is a code that tells java to insert a parameter into
# this space when displaying it to the user.  In this case,
# the parameter that is inserted is a date.
#
# The 0 indicates that this is where the first parameter is
# inserted in the string.  There may be more than one parameter
# in any one string.  The 'date' tells java to format this
# parameter as a date.
#
# The {0,date} code should be placed at the appropriate position
# in the translated text.  Please note that the code in the
# translation must match exactly the code in the original
# string.
#
# The developer should describe in comments above the string to be
# translated each of the parameters so that you will be able to
# determine where the best location for each parameter in the
# translated string.
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should not be
# translated.
