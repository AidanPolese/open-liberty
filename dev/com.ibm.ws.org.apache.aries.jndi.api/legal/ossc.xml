   <notes>
   The source code in this project is from the Apache Aries repository https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/aries/branches/java6support,
   checked out revision 1801418.
   
   During our build we are patching the org.apache.aries.jndi.startup.Activator class in the org.apache.aries.jndi.core-1.0.1.jar bundle.
   This ossc file should be merged back into the ossc.xml if and when we reconsume all Apache Aries components at the same level.
