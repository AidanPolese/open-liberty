unbreakableExecutorHang=CWWKE1200W:  All threads in the Liberty default executor appear to be hung.  Liberty automatically increased the number of threads from {0} to {1}.  However, all threads still appear to be hung.
unbreakableExecutorHang.explanation=An error occurred which caused an executor to  hang and the Liberty run time added a significant number of threads in an attempt to end the hang condition.  However, the executor remains in an unresponsive state.  
unbreakableExecutorHang.useraction=Determine if there is a bottleneck, such as a locked database table, that might prevent threads from resolving in the server.  If no such bottleneck exists and the server legitimately requires additional threads, adjust the coreThreads attribute of the executor configuration element.

CWWKE1201.queue.full.abort=CWWKE1201E: Task cannot be submitted to executor {0} because the task queue with maxQueueSize of {1} is at capacity and the maxWaitForEnqueue of {2} has been reached. Task submission is aborted per the queueFullAction.
CWWKE1201.queue.full.abort.explanation=The maxQueueSize attribute controls how many task submissions can queue up. The maxWaitForEnqueue attribute controls how long to wait for a qeueue position to become available. The queueFullAction attribute determines what action to take after the interval elapses and there is still no queue position available. When the chosen action is abort, this error is raised to fail the task submission.
CWWKE1201.queue.full.abort.useraction=No action is necessary if the application handles RejectedExecutionException. Otherwise, consider increasing the maxQueueSize or maxWaitForEnqueue or using a different queueFullAction.

CWWKE1202.submit.after.shutdown=CWWKE1202E: Task cannot be submitted because the executor {0} has been shut down.
CWWKE1202.submit.after.shutdown.explanation=Task submissions are not permitted after the executor service has been requested to shut down.
CWWKE1202.submit.after.shutdown.useraction=Only submit tasks on an executor service instance which has not been requested to shut down.

CWWKE1203.config.update.after.shutdown=CWWKE1203E: Configuration update to {0} is not permitted because the executor {1} has been shut down.
CWWKE1203.config.update.after.shutdown.explanation=It is not possible to update configuration after the executor service has been requested to shut down.
CWWKE1203.config.update.after.shutdown.useraction=Only update configuration of an executor service instance which has not been requested to shut down.
