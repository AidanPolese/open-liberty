   <notes>
   Apache Felix Gogo is an apache release and thus needs no further approval.  The org.apache.felix.gogo.command-0.16.0-sources.jar
   is not included in the release.  It was built by David Jencks locally from the released org.apache.felix.gogo.command-0.16.0-project.tar.gz
   by changing the maven-bundle-plugin to 1.4.3 in the pom.xml and running mvn source:jar.
