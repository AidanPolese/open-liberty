warn.provider.no.public.ctor=CWWKW0100W: The JAX-RS Provider class, {0} in the application contains no public constructor. The server will ignore this provider.
warn.provider.no.public.ctor.explanation=The JAX-RS specification requires that provider classes must contain at least one public constructor for the JAX-RS container implementation to invoke. The specified provider class does not contain a public constructor, so the server will ignore it.
warn.provider.no.public.ctor.useraction=If the application requires this provider, then this class must be modified to include at least one public constructor.  See section 4.1.2 of the JAX-RS 2.0 (JSR 339) specification for more information.
