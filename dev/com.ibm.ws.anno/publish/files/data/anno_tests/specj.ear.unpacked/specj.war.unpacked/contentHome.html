<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="-1">The SPEC<SUP>TM</SUP> performance benchmark SPECjAppServer2008 provides a  workload for characterizing the performance of various J2EE Application Servers. The workloads consist of an end to end web based order processing domain backed by an RMI driven manufactoring domain. The application  is a collection of Java classes, Java Servlets, Java Server Pages and Enterprise Java Beans built to the open J2EE APIs. Together these provide versatile and portable test cases designed to measure aspects of scalability and performance for all J2EE middleware vendors.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

SPECjAppServer2008 is the third generation of the SPEC organization's J2EE end-to-end industry standard benchmark  application. The new SPECjAppServer2008 benchmark has been re-designed and developed to cover the J2EE specification's significantly expanded programming model, highlighting the major features used by developers in the industry today. This provides a real world workload driving the Application Server's implementation of the JEE specification to its maximum potential.<BR>
<BR>
SPECjAppServer2008's new design spans JEE5 including the new EJB 3.0 and WSEE component architecture, Message Driven beans, and transactions (1-phase, 2-phase commit).<BR>
